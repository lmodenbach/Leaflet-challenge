# Leaflet-challenge
Geo-mapping project drawing recent earthquake data in as a json from the USGS API and tectonic plate GeoJSON data from an included file. Visualization allows users to choose between three base maps and two dataset overlays which toggle independently. Earthquakes are plotted with magnitude reflected in size of radius and depth reflected along a color spectrum. Popups on both the earthquakes and tectonic plate boundaries provide summary data.
